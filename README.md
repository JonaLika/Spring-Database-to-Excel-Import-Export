# Spring Database-to-Excel Import/Export 

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use Spring to import and export data between a database and an Excel file.


## Tech Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- Spring Boot: for building and configuring the application
- Spring Data JPA: for connecting to the database and executing queries
- Apache POI: for reading and writing Excel files
- PostgreSQL: as the database engine

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Java 11 or later
- PostgreSQL 8 or later
- Maven 3 or later

You'll also need to set up a database and a user with the necessary privileges to create tables and execute queries. To do this, you can use the following commands:

    mysql -u root -p
    CREATE DATABASE example_db;
    CREATE USER 'example_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'example_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON example_db.* TO 'example_user'@'localhost';

Once you have the database set up, you can clone this repository and run the following command to build and run the project

    mvn spring-boot:run

## Using the Application
Once the application is running, you can use the following endpoints to import and export data:

- GET /export-to-excel: exports data from the database to an Excel file
- POST /import-to-db : imports data from an Excel file into the database

You can test the endpoints using a tool like cURL or Postman. 

## Customizing the Application
You can customize the application by editing the application.properties file. Here are some of the properties you can modify:

- spring.datasource.url: the URL of the database connection
- spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password: the username and password for the database user
- spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto: the strategy for updating the database schema
- spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect: the database dialect to use for generating SQL queries

## Conclusion
This project provides a simple example of how to use Spring to import and export data between a database and an Excel file. It can be easily customized and extended to handle more complex use cases or different data formats.
